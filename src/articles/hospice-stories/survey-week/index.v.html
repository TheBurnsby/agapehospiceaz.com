		<p>Once again, Monday arrived. It was a pleasant Spring morning in Tucson, and April, our Administrator and lead Compliance Officer, was checking in online to view our account home page in the Joint Commission’s website.  After months of waiting, she finally saw a notification in the events calendar. Our surveyor was set to arrive at the office at 8:30 AM that morning to begin a four day in depth accreditation survey of our hospice. April sent messages to key staff to notify the rest of the team that the survey was beginning. Thus began our triennial survey week with the Joint Commission.</p>

		<p>Before getting too far into how the survey week actually went, let us first step back and address what accreditation is. To operate a hospice, there are certain minimum standards that an agency must achieve in order to legally get into, and maintain, a hospice operation. </p>

		<p>In order to open their doors, a hospice must receive a license from the department of health services from the state within which it is operating. Once the agency obtains their state license, they can begin providing hospice services. Unfortunately for that hospice, outside of individuals who can afford to pay for services privately, the hospice will not have many people interested in their services, because they won’t have any contracts with any insurances, including Medicare.</p>

		<p>According to the 2015 Hospice Facts and Figures Report published by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), 85.5% of patients that received hospice care in 2014 had their hospice care paid for entirely by Medicare. Only 0.8% of hospice patients paid for their care privately, out of their own pockets. For a new hospice to have a viable option for receiving funding for their hospice program, they will have to expand away from just providing care to individuals who can self-fund their care. They will have to get contracts with insurance companies, and may look into getting certified by Medicare.</p>

		<p>Since 85.5% of patients that receive hospice care have Medicare benefits, most new hospice agencies go that direction. To achieve this, in addition to obtaining the state license, the hospice agency must also pursue a Medicare certification. Once a Medicare certification is obtained, the hospice can begin billing Medicare for hospice care that they deliver to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

		<p>Obtaining this Medicare certification can be a long process. The agency must begin by providing hospice care to a limited number of patients, without receiving reimbursement. They must maintain for a period of time while they wait for Medicare surveyors to arrive and survey the hospice agency, making sure that the services being provided meet Medicare’s conditions of participation. If the surveyors deem that the hospice agency is meeting the conditions of participation, Medicare will issue the hospice agency a certificate, and the hospice agency will become a Medicare provider. Once this occurs, the hospice can begin billing Medicare.</p>

		<p>There is an alternative way to receive a Medicare certification, and that is through accreditation. The process of a hospice agency becoming accredited is similar to the process of becoming certified by Medicare. The hospice agency begins providing hospice care to a limited number of patients, but instead of Medicare surveyors coming to assess the hospice’s operation, a member of an accrediting body comes to assess the hospice agency.</p>

		<p>Organizations that provide accreditation services typically hold hospices to a higher standard than the base line Medicare standards. There are typically two levels of accreditation. There is a level of accreditation that indicates the hospice has met the standards of the accrediting organization. There is another level of accreditation that indicates that the hospice agency has not only fully met the accrediting organization’s standards of excellence, but that they have also met all of the Medicare and state specific conditions of participation. This second level of accreditation is called Deemed Status.</p>

		<p>When an agency achieves Deemed Status with an accrediting organization, the accrediting organization writes a letter to the state, and to Medicare, indicating that this hospice is meeting all the necessary standards of care. Upon receipt of this letter, Medicare provides the hospice with a letter of certification, and that hospice becomes a Medicare hospice provider. In addition to being a Medicare provider, the hospice gets that accrediting organization’s seal of excellence. Depending on the quality and reputation of the accrediting organization, that seal is an indication that this hospice has made an effort to provide the highest level of quality care.</p>

		<p>In 2013, Agape Hospice elected to have the Joint Commission be our accrediting body. On March 6th, 2013, we received the Joint Commission’s deemed status accreditation. Accreditation certifications require a re-accreditation survey once every three years.</p>

		<p>We chose the Joint Commission as our accreditation organization because we admired their reputation in the health care community. They are known for having the highest standards of excellence. While we could have had it easier with other accrediting organizations, we chose the Joint Commission because we knew that in our efforts to adhere to their rigorous standards, we would be pushed to maintain the highest level of quality in our day to day operation. Ever since March 6th, 2013, we have proudly displayed their seal of approval on a prominent wall in our clinical headquarters. </p>

		<p>It does not take hard math to calculate that in March of this year, 2016, we would be due for a new seal of approval. Standing between us and that re-accreditation was a four-day survey to be conducted, unannounced, at some point during our survey window. The survey window, we were told, was anytime between November of 2015 and March of 2016.</p>

		<p>The only notice we would get about when the survey would actually take place was by an alert on our account home page in the Joint Commission website. That is why April was looking at that page, that pleasant Spring morning in March. </p>

		<p>We had been preparing for the survey since the last survey ended, but as the due date of the pending survey approached, we worked very hard, dotting every i and crossing every t. We continuously reviewed the standards and assessed our systems, making sure that we were performing at a high level.

		<p>By the time the surveyor arrived at our office, our team was prepared to show her how we fulfill the mission of hospice. During her opening meeting with our leadership team, the surveyor told us that she was here to validate our work, to offer insights for improvement, and to inspire the team, and that is exactly what she did. </p>

		<p>Soon after that opening meeting, the Surveyor made plans to shadow several members of our team in the field, with a goal of observing their clinical skills at work at the bedside. One of the people she shadowed was Dana, one of our amazing hospice nurses. The surveyor remarked to the leadership team that on her shadowing visit with Dana, Dana had to perform wound care on the patient she was seeing. The surveyor remarked in her recap of that visit that the wound care Dana performed was some of the best wound care she had seen in the field in quite some time.</p>

		<p>In another update to the leadership team, the surveyor explained how she had observed another one of our hospice nurses, Sylvia, and one of hospice aides, Rosy, dialogue about the plan of care for a patient that they both had under their care. Rosy explained to Sylvia that the patient’s decline was inhibiting her ability to safely, and comfortably get out of bed. Sylvia agreed and updated the care plan to include bed baths, instead of full trips to the shower. </p>

		<p>The surveyor also interviewed numerous members of our team about their roles in the organization. One of the groups she spent time talking to was our social services and grief support teams. She asked Belinda, a member of our bereavement team, about the support groups that we facilitate. As Belinda explained how our groups worked, the surveyor was reminded of a grief support group that she had attended as a part of her own, recent, grief journey. The surveyor explained that in one of the groups she attended, the facilitator had brought a bunch of rocks. The rocks were of all shapes and sizes. They had varying color and appearance. Some were nice and smooth, others rough and jagged. The people attending the group were asked to pick up a rock that best described their grief journey, and then explain why they had chosen that specific rock. </p>

		<p>By the end of this discussion on how we support the bereaved, there were hugs and tears as the discussion around the importance of grief support was had. The surveyor was supported by our team, while at the same time inspiring our team to explore new modes of facilitating grief support for those we care for.</p>

		<p>The surveyor met with leaders in our clinical department to assess our processes for managing medications. In her exit meeting, she remarked at how thorough and effective the process for medication management appeared to be. </p>

		<p>She met with April to discuss our process for identifying areas in our organization that from time to time require performance improvements. April explained how we track key quality measure in our program, and how we meet on a quarterly basis to review that data, to discuss it, and to develop plans for improvement when necessary.</p>

		<p>She had more great things to say about the various people and teams that she met with than we have space to outline here. From the volunteer team, to the spiritual care team, to our physicians; she consistently found positive things to give feedback on.</p>

		<p>When Thursday, the final day of the survey, finally arrived, the surveyor noted to us that she was planning to have her final exit meeting with us at 3:30pm that afternoon. We sent out an email to our whole team, inviting them to attend that exit meeting, to hear her recap of how we are doing as an agency. Our hope was that whether the exit meeting went well, or went south, it would be a learning experience for our whole team.</p>

		<p>As 3:30 approached, our large conference room began to fill up with team members. A few minutes after 3:30, the surveyor came out of the room in which she had been working on her final report, her final assessment on how we are doing as a hospice.</p>

		<p>She entered the conference room and was somewhat surprised to see so many people there to hear her report. She started out by telling us that we had an amazing team. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. She went on to highlight several of the things that most impressed her throughout her week of observing our team. She outlined some areas that she believed we could improve on. </p>

		<p>While there were several items that she highlighted as areas that we can improve on, she said that many of the common issues that she finds at most hospice agencies’ first triennial, re-accreditation survey were not areas of weakness for our team. She mentioned that she frequently cites hospices on infection control protocols and medication management deficiencies, but that neither one of those areas presented a cause for concern for her at Agape Hospice.</p>

		<p>The exit meeting ended with her encouraging the team to give themselves a round of applause. She did exactly what she set out to do. She validated the great hospice care that our team provides. She highlighted some things that we could do better. She inspired the team to keep up the great work. </p>

		<p>As a team, we look forward to continuing to deliver consistently excellent, high quality hospice care to people on their final journey, and to their loved ones who continue on with cherished memories. We are excited to have the Joint Commission seal of approval hanging on our wall for three more years, and we look forward to welcoming the next surveyor from the Joint Commission to validate our team in 2019.</p>
