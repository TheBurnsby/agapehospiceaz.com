		<p>It was a chilly Saturday morning and April, our Administrator, arrived at the skilled nursing home to see our patient who was entering his second day of inpatient services for his terminal agitation.</p>

		<p>Terminal agitation tends to occur frequently at the end stages of a terminal disease. The main symptoms are typically agitation, sudden muscle jerks or twitching, irritability and impaired consciousness.</p>

		<p>Two days earlier, our team was wrapping up another day of work. Late in the afternoon a call came in from a local skilled nursing facility saying that they had a patient who needed urgent care from our hospice team. Within a short amount of time, Fran, one of our admissions nurses, was on the scene evaluating Everett for hospice. She discussed Everett’s disease and symptoms with our on-call physician, Dr. Kelly, and decided to admit him to inpatient care for treatment of that terminal agitation previously mentioned.</p>

		<p>When April arrived at Everett’s room two days later, he was not doing well. He was extremely agitated. Despite numerous visits the previous day from many members of our hospice team, Everett’s agitation and confusion was persisting. He had wound himself up in his sheets, appeared disheveled, and his breathing was fast paced. He appeared to be in physical and emotional turmoil.</p>

		<p>April quickly started helping Everett up in his bed. As she started working to get Everett settled and laying peacefully in his bed, Heidi arrived and immediately started assisting April.</p>

		<p>Heidi is a member of our social work team. The previous day, her and Katherine, the leader of our social work team, had stepped in and began working on a long-term residential care plan for Everett, should he need a place to live after his in-patient care. Seeing that Everett’s decline was happening fast, they looked to see what, if any, financial resources he had. It was limited.</p>

		<p>They found out that Everett was a veteran of the Korean War. He had spent four years in the Air Force. Having served in active duty during wartime gave Everett potential access to long-term care benefits that could help him with paying for assisted living care. It also made services at the VA hospital a possible option. The team opened up communication with the VA and began coordinating a potential longer-term solution for Everett.</p>

		<p>Everett’s time spent protecting our country also meant that our team would get to be a part of honoring him for his service, under our We Honor Veterans program. Our volunteer coordinator, Rosy, coordinates our veteran honoring ceremonies. She was alerted of Everett’s service in the Air Force. She was also told the time sensitive nature of Everett’s prognosis.</p>

		<p>Rosy immediately got to work coordinating an effort to honor Everett. Derek, a member of our volunteer team, and also an active duty member of our military, agreed to conduct the ceremony the following morning. A note went out to our care team that the ceremony would be taking place on Saturday, and that anyone who could attend, was welcome.

		<p>Once April had helped Everett get resituated in his bed that Saturday, Derek and Gary arrived to help April and Heidi in honoring Everett for his military service. Everett’s health was beginning to really decline. His energy levels were waning.</p>

		<p>Derek, who had arrived in his full military uniform, knelt next to Everett’s bed. He took Everett’s hand and quietly thanked him for his service. Derek said “I want to honor you for paving the path for me and other soldiers like me.” This resonated with Everett. For the first time that day, Everett opened his eyes in a brief moment of clarity, looked at Derek, and said “Thank you.”</p>

		<p>Everett’s wife passed away several years ago. When Everett was initially evaluated by our hospice, the only close friend or relative that he had to speak for him was a former sister-in-law. She lived out of state, but was very willing to work with us to develop a plan of care that best aligned with Everett’s best interests and wishes. Everett’s sister-in-law was a good friend to Everett. She called him on a weekly basis. She had indicated to Gary, our chaplain, that Everett was a Christian, and that praying with him would be a great comfort.</p>

		<p>The previous day, Everett’s sister-in-law had called April while she had been doing a nursing visit with Everett. She wanted to speak with Everett. April explained that he was not able to carry a conversation, but agreed that hearing her voice could be a comfort to him. April was able to put her phone on speakerphone and set it close to Everett’s ear. Through audible tears, his sister-in-law was able to assure Everett of her family’s love for him, and that he wasn’t alone.</p>

		<p>April indicated that hearing her voice seemed to give Everett a real peace. April was then able to have a longer conversation with Everett’s sister-in-law, speaking at length about Everett’s condition, and giving her up to date information on how he was doing. His sister-in-law said that she was grateful for the opportunity to speak to him, and wanted to make sure the hospice team knew to reinforce with him that his family loved him and cared for him, even though they could not be there in person.</p>

		<p>That Saturday, after Everett had been honored for his military service, April was cleaning up his room. Gary was by Everett’s side. He prayed with him. April said that she noticed that as Gary prayed, Everett’s respirations slowed. He seemed more at peace than he had through the first 2 days of his care.</p>

		<p>When they had made sure Everett was comfortable and at peace, April conferred with the skilled nursing home nurse who would continue to monitor Everett. They discussed his medications and his condition. April, Derek, and Heidi said good-bye to him and left. Gary stayed behind a little longer.</p>

		<p>Before leaving Gary played Amazing Grace on his phone. He had played it the day before while he was visiting Everett, and he said that the song seemed to bring Everett a deeper sense of peace. Gary prayed once more with Everett, who by now was in a much more peaceful state than they had encountered him in that morning. He was comfortable and resting.</p>

		<p>Seeing that he was at peace, Gary eventually left Everett’s room.  Two hours later our on-call team received a call from the nursing home. Everett had passed away peacefully in his bed. Samira, our social worker who was working on-call that day, coordinated his funeral plans.</p>

		<p>According to the 2015 facts and figures report published by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association, the average number of days that a patient is on hospice services is 72 days. While Everett’s length of stay was shorter than average, our approach to his care was the same. He received holistic, individualized care from a hospice team that was committed to his peace and comfort.</p>
