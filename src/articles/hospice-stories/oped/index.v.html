		<p>A <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.68.9257" target="_blank">recent study</a> published by the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) indicates that hospice care at the end-of-life for patients suffering from a terminal cancer diagnosis improves patient satisfaction and the fulfillment of end-of-life wishes, but the benefits appear to be dependent on how long the patient actually received hospice care.</p>

		<p>In this particular study, the researchers interviewed 2,307 families of deceased patients that suffered from advanced lung or colorectal cancer, who were enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study, and who died in 2011.</p>

		<p>They compared family-reported outcomes for the patients who received hospice care at EOL and those patients who did not receive any hospice care. The outcomes compared included “the presence and relief of common symptoms (ie, pain, dyspnea [a.k.a. shortness of breath]), concordance with patients’ wishes for EOL care and place of death, and quality of EOL care.”</p>

		<p><strong>The results on the various outcomes were as follows:</strong></p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Pain Management: 80% of the families of those enrolled in hospice care reported that their loved ones received “just the right” amount of pain medicine. This compares to 73% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li>
			<li>Help with Shortness of Breath: 78% of the of the families of those enrolled in hospice care reported that their loved one got help with shortness of breath at the end-of-life. This compares to just 70% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li>
			<li>EOL Wishes Being Followed: 80% of those enrolled in hospice had their end-of-life wishes followed. This in comparison to just 74% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li>
			<li>Quality of EOL Care: The families of those who were enrolled in hospice reported that their loved one received “excellent” end-of-life care 15% more frequently than those who did not receive hospice care.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>While these results are exceptional, the one factor that improved the scores most dramatically in favor of hospice care utilization was the number of days a person received hospice care leading up to their death.</p>

		<p>For those who received less than eight total days of hospice care, the difference on those quality care indicators was negligible, and in fact the most significant differences surfaced when people entered hospice care 30 days or more prior to their death.</p>

		<p>At Agape Hospice, we see this in practice every day. In this particular study, the terminal illness happened to be cancer, however I would venture a guess that the same outcome would be true for people afflicted by just about all terminal disease processes.</p>

		<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is the world’s leading professional organization for physicians and oncology professionals caring for people with cancer. They set various outcome measures for determining the quality of oncology patient care. One of their quality measures is “administering hospice care”, however they only focus on administering three to seven days of care.</p>

		<p>According to the JCO study, “Encouraging earlier and increased hospice enrollment may improve EOL experiences for patients with cancer and their families.”</p>

		<p>I believe the JCO study shows the importance of improving on that quality metric by putting an emphasis on even earlier enrollment in hospice care, and I am pleased that the researchers encouraged the same. </p>

		<p>As the JCO study concluded, “Hospice care is associated with better symptom relief, patient-goal attainment, and quality of EOL care.” At a time when solutions in the American health care system seem to be coming at an increasing premium, we need more emphasis on programs such as hospice, that put the patient at the center of the equation.</p>
