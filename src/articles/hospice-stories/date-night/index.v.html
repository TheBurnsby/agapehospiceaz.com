		<h1>Date Night</h1>

		<p>One of the core functions of a hospice is to assess and support the emotional needs of our patients and their loved ones. This is exactly what our social worker, Samira, was doing when she identified the need to plan an unforgettable date night for one of our patients, and his wife. </p>

		<p>Several years ago, suffering from the debilitating effects of a stroke, Bob (name has been changed for confidentiality) was living at home, and Patsy, his wife (her name is also changed), was his primary caregiver. As Bob continued to decline in his functional capacity, the amount of care Patsy needed to give him was becoming too much for her to handle on her own. This forced her to make a decision that no family caregiver takes lightly. She made the decision to move him to a nursing home where he would receive around the clock care, relieving her of that impossible responsibility. </p>

		<p>As the years went by, Bob continued his slow physical decline. Patsy was faithful to visit him as often as she could. In September of 2015, with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live, Bob was referred to our hospice. Upon his admission to hospice, both he and Patsy immediately began receiving personalized care, assessing Bob’s physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, as well as Patsy’s supporting needs. </p>

		<p>As Bob declined physically, so did his ability to communicate effectively. He struggled to convey his true feelings about his surroundings, and about the people who surrounded him, often coming across in his gesturing as frustrated, angry, and annoyed. </p>

		<p>One day, Samira sat down with Patsy to talk about how she was handling all that was going on with Bob. Patsy shared with Samira that it had become increasingly difficult to visit Bob. Patsy was beginning to feel like Bob did not appreciate her like he used to. He always seemed agitated when she visited him, and she was concerned he did not love her anymore. Samira did her best to reassure Patsy, but realized she would have to get Bob’s side of the story, and see whether or not this was just a result of Bob’s declining ability to communicate effectively.</p>

		<p>The next time Samira met with Bob, she asked him about his feelings regarding his wife. She asked him if he still loved her, and if he appreciated her visiting him. He lit up. In his own special communicative style, Bob affirmed that he did very much love his wife, and that her visits were extremely meaningful to him. Wanting to make sure Patsy was reassured of this, Samira began putting together a plan.</p>

		<p>She asked Bob if he would like to partner with her in setting up a date night for him and his wife. Nothing over the top, but special enough to reassure Patsy that Bob’s love for her was still alive and full. With a squeeze of a hand, and nod of the head, he affirmed that he was in full support of this endeavor, and indicated that he felt it was a wonderful idea.</p>

		<p>The original plan was for it to be a surprise, but during a phone call with Patsy, to feel out what the best evening would be for her to pay a visit to the nursing home, Samira found out that Patsy had suffered a fall that week, and had broken her wrist. Seeing that the date night might be postponed a little bit, Samira decided to bring Patsy in on the secret plans, so as to avoid any confusion over why she would need to visit Bob on a specific evening.</p>

		<p>Patsy was ecstatic over the idea of having one more date night with her true love. She immediately began giving Samira some additional information to help Samira in her planning. She explained to Samira that back in the day, Bob used to take her to their favorite restaurant, Old Father Inn where they would always order ribs, and that the ribs always came with a nice salad and a baked potato.</p>

		<p>For additional help with logistics and date night entertainment, Samira went to our volunteer coordinator, Rosy. Once she heard the outline and plan, Rosy was all over it. She immediately rallied two of our amazing volunteers to help out. One volunteer, a former nurse named Kathy, would help with decorating the private dining room at the nursing home. Another volunteer, Dani, one of our talented musicians, would be there on date night to entertain the two lovebirds with some accordion music. Rosy played an important role in coordinating the volunteers on date night.</p>

		<p>Once Patsy had regained enough strength to get back to the nursing home for a visit and a dinner, Samira set the date and time. The date would take place at 5pm on a Thursday evening. That Wednesday, Samira paid Bob a visit to remind him of the date the following night. Bob expressed that he was very excited, and ready to go.</p>

		<p>On Thursday, Samira arrived an hour early to start getting everything set up. When she arrived at the nursing home, she went straight to the private dining room where date night would be taking place. When she reached the room, Bob was already there. He had gotten himself from his room to the dining room an hour early in anticipation of the date. </p>

		<p>The volunteers arrived, and together with the help of the wonderful nursing home staff, they put together a beautiful date setting. Samira had also picked up a love-note card for Bob to give to his wife. She helped him sign it.</p>

		<p>Once decorating was underway, Samira left to pick up the dinner at Old Father Inn. She also grabbed them a dessert and some flowers. When she returned, Patsy had already arrived, and the two were sitting at their table, holding hands, and listening to accordion music together. Samira served them their meal and left the two to enjoy their date.</p>

		<p>In the coming days, Patsy shared with Samira that she was incredibly appreciative of what Samira, and the volunteers had put together for her and Bob that night. She said that she had a wonderful time and that she “never would have expected a hospice to do something like that.” </p>

		<p>The reality is that hospice does do stuff like this. In hospice, we are tasked with providing personalized physical, emotional, and spiritual care to our patients and their families. For this family, that meant planning a date night.</p>
