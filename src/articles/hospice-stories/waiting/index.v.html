		<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of hospice care is openness. We believe strongly that in order to facilitate quality care and support at the end of a person’s life, we must have openness. We must have openness within our team, with the one who is dying, and with their family and loved ones. Without openness, last wishes can be missed, final words can go unsaid, and final good-byes can be lost. It was openness that prompted Carol to come sooner, rather than later, to bid farewell to her sister Mary.</p>

		<p>We got the call on a Tuesday in late February, that a patient at a local nursing home was in urgent need of hospice care. Our admission nurse, Noel, arrived on site and confirmed that Mary was not doing well. She was suffering from the end stages of terminal dementia.</p>

		<p>Mary had a sister named Carol. Carol lived in New York. When Mary came on to hospice services, we informed Carol of this update, and shared with her that her sister was not doing well, and that we recommended she come to visit soon. Carol said that she had plans to come in April to spend some time with her sister. We openly explained to Carol that Mary was not doing well, and would most likely not make it until April. If she wanted to spend some time with her sister, she needed to move her travel plans to a closer date.</p>

		<p>A few days later, on Thursday, Katherine, Mary’s hospice social worker, made a visit to the nursing home. She observed that Mary was no longer eating. Mary’s hospice nurse, Sylvia, coordinated with the hospice doctor, and the care team at the nursing home to make sure that Mary was comfortable. One of our volunteers, Rose, spent time with Mary, just being there with her, providing her with companionship.</p>

		<p>Katherine called Carol to inform her that Mary was no longer eating or drinking, and that once that phase of the dying process began, Mary only had a couple of days left. Carol said she had moved her plans from April to the following Tuesday. Katherine told her that typically once someone was no longer eating or drinking, five days is usually the longest the body can continue functioning. Tuesday was six days away. Katherine openly recommended that Carol move her plans again to be there even sooner.</p>

		<p>On Sunday, one of our on-call nurses, Linda, paid a visit to Mary. She assessed her, and spoke with the nursing home staff. Mary was not responding to any verbal or physical stimuli. She was still alive, and she was comfortable, but she did not have much time left. </p>

		<p>Linda placed a call to Carol to inform her of her sister’s serious condition. Carol said that she had moved her plans again. She had just landed in Tucson and was getting off the plane. Linda openly discussed Mary’s condition, and recommended to Carol that she come straight to the nursing home. Carol affirmed that as soon as she picked up the rental car, she would head straight over.</p>

		<p>Linda also spoke with Gary, our hospice chaplain. He made a phone call and spoke with Carol. She was thankful for his comforting call, but did not request a spiritual care visit.</p>

		<p>As soon as she picked up her rental car, Carol went straight to the nursing home. She was able to be there with her sister. Mary passed away just a few hours later. In a phone call with Carol the day after Mary had passed, Belinda, our bereavement coordinator, spoke to her about the whole experience. Carol had this to say:</p>

		<p>"I'm tired but doing good. I'm so glad I was able to get here to spend the last 3 hours with my sister before she died. I was so happy for her that her spirit was released. I'm sitting back now and resting a bit. I can't say enough about everyone at hospice. I don't know where you find these kind, caring, and helpful people. It didn't matter who I spoke with. Everyone was wonderful. I could be churning with anxiety, but every time I would hang up the phone after talking to one of you I felt calm and realized everything was going to be okay. </p>

		<p>The more I hear that my sister was waiting for me, the more I am starting to believe it. I kept telling her it was Carol. I'd kiss her forehead and stroke her hair. I was holding her hand and talking to her. I gave her permission to go and within 10 second she stopped breathing. She did breathe again, but it was the beginning of the end. I truly believe now that she was waiting for me. </p>

		<p>I am really sad and tears flow, but at the same time I am happy that she could let go and set her spirit free. So many of the staff popped in and told me stories before she died. It was like an Irish wake. It was a chapter I would otherwise not have known. I got great insight of who she was at the nursing home and I guess she was a pistol. I feel so amazed. People kept saying she was waiting for me. I'm so thankful she did. </p>

		<p>I met with the funeral home. Agape made this process easier too because of some form they provided the funeral home. I am grateful to you all from the bottom of my heart. You all made it so easy for me to be present with her yesterday. Please say thank you to everyone else that you work with. I may not have met them, but that is because they were helping other family members like myself.”</p>

		<p>Mary and Carol’s story is one of openness. The hospice team was open with Carol about the realities of Mary’s condition. Carol was open with Mary about her love for her. Without openness, it is very difficult to manage care, emotions, and relationships at the end of life. With openness, we can help bring comfort, peace, and resolution into every life that we are invited in to.</p>
