       					<p>I have 23 years experience in Hospice, from Primary Care Nurse/ Case Manager to Clinical Coordinator of a small, hospital based Hospice in Connecticut for several years. Prior to my move to Tucson I was the  Clinical Outreach Coordinator and Educator for a 100 patient Hospice and Palliative Care Program in Norwich, Connecticut. My responsibilities included both staff and community education. I presented on Hospice and Alzheimer’s Disease at the Alzheimer’s State Conference in 2015.</p>

						<p>I moved from Connecticut to Tucson last year to be closer to family. I started at Agape Hospice and Palliative Care as the Clinical Nurse Manager and currently work in Compliance and Nursing Education. I am responsible for reviewing and auditing our charts to maintain our high standards for JCAHO compliance.</p>

						<p>I live in Tucson with my husband of 29 years. We have 7 grandchildren and 2 great great-grandchildren in our extended family. And our newest family member is our 11 pound mixed breed dog, Scruffy, who is adored by all of the kids. </p>

       					<p>As Director of Social Services, Katherine Perkins is our number one problem solver. She works one on one with many of our patients making sure they get all the financial benefits they are entitled to, setting up advanced directives, and coordinating care plans with other care providers our patients interface with. For those patients she does not directly work with, she oversees our team of social workers, making sure every patient’s social service needs are met. With over 8 years of experience in social work, Katherine is a great community resource for us, and our patients.</p>
       					<p>Katherine loves working with the senior population. She had a very close relationship with her grand-parents and step-grandparents, and watched them battle terminal illness. It was during this time that she made her decision to become a social worker. Working in hospice has provided her the opportunity to work with the community she loves during their end of life process. She enjoys learning so much from the people and family’s we serve everyday. In her spare time she enjoys experimental cooking. While she admits cooking is not her strong point, she loves doing it none-the-less.</p>

       					<p>Gary Henry has worked in healthcare for 20+ years, 5 of those years being a hospice chaplain. The last 5 years being the most significant and rewarding years of his adult working life. Gary doesn't see his role as a job as much as he sees it as a true ministry. While Gary comes from the Christian faith, he coordinates with ministers from all faiths, ensuring that each patient’s spiritual needs are met, regardless of their spiritual background.</p>

						<p>The hospice chaplain provides spiritual counseling and support during a time when that counseling and support is most important. Gary Henry is just the person to provide that important service to our patients, their loved ones, and those involved in the care process. Gary meets individually with patients and their loved ones, when requested, to discuss spirituality, it’s role in the dying process, and what it means for both the patient, and their family.</p>

						<p>Gary’s interests include spending time with his wife Kim Henry, and 3 kids. He loves participating in his kids activities, which include attending wallyball tournaments, sporting events and other things important to them.</p>
