			<h3>Social Services</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>The end of life journey can be a difficult time with many documents to prepare, family concerns to navigate, and financial issues that pile up. Every patient under our hospice care is assigned a social worker whose job it is to help our patients and their loved ones navigate these challenging areas.</p>

			<p>If plans are not in place, or even if they are out of date, our social work team can help patients and their loved ones put together, among other things, necessary power of attorney documents, living wills, and funeral arrangements. The social work team can also work with patients to connect them to other potential resources necessary to assist with other aspects of your health care costs.</p>

			<p>If you are interested in working as a social worker, we would love to meet you. Please contact us and see if a rewarding career as a hospice social worker is right for you.</p>
