			<hr>
			<p>When you make the decision to pursue hospice care, the hospice physician reviews your medical record, assesses your medical diagnosis, and helps make the determination that the diagnosis is terminal. Once this assessment is made, our hospice physicians work with the rest of our team to develop a plan of care that meets your holistic needs.</p>

			<p>As your hospice care unfolds, our hospice physicians remain an active part of your care team guiding you on your journey. They continue to meet with you, face-to-face, throughout the course of your hospice care, ensuring that the care you are receiving meets your goals.</p>
