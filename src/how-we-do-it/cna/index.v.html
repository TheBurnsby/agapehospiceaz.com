		<h3>Hospice Aide</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Our hospice aide service is an essential element to our holistic approach to end-of-life care. Every patient, assuming they accept our offering of this service, is assigned a hospice aide who comes out a minimum of twice a week to assist with showering, bed baths, dressing, and general hygiene care. Our hospice aides are extra eyes and ears helping keep the nurse and the doctor up to date on day to day changes in the patientâ€™s condition.</p>

		<p>Aside from providing their hands on assistive care, our hospice aides are a friendly face and a caring heart that meet the patient where they are, providing social interaction, and focused one on one care.</p>
