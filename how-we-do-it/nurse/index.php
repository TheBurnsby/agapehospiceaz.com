			<h3>Hospice Nurse</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Every patient in our hospice care is assigned a nurse case manager. Hospice nurses work to coordinate all aspects of care for the patient, their caregivers, and their loved ones. The hospice nurse ensures that the patient, as well as their family, is kept fully informed on the patientâ€™s final journey.</p>

			<p>Our nursing team comes to you, meeting you in the comfort and privacy of your own home. Each nurse is given a mobile nursing bag complete with everything necessary to provide a physical assessment at each visit. This mobile nursing kit includes an iPad that allows for up to the minute charting of patient information into our electronic medical record. This allows us to get medications and medical supplies ordered in a timely manner and scheduled for delivery directly to the patient.</p>

			<p>In between visits, patients on service with Agape Hospice have access to a nurse 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This can provide peace of mind, knowing that a knowledgeable, caring, and compassionate advocate for your care is only a phone call away.</p>

			<p>If you are interested in working as a hospice nurse, we would love to meet you. Click hear and see if a rewarding career in hospice nursing is right for you.</p>
