				article: '<p>Many people see hospice as a group that helps people die. If we, however, do our jobs well, I believe the more accurate description of hospice is that we help dying people live. Recently our team was given another opportunity to do this.<p>In April of 2017, we had the privilege of welcoming Mary (name changed to protect her identity) into our hospice care. Mary is a retired school teacher who, like many women, loves to look lovely. She is a lady of fashion who knows her way around the make-up cabinet. While her natural beauty is still evident to all who meet her, time and the onset of her terminal illness have limited her ability and energy to get made up every day, to put on her favorite gowns, to apply her favorite shades of make-up, and to really live.<p><img class="inline-img" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbc2wlvk8/image/upload/f_auto,fl_any_format.lossy/v1500588509/agape/hospice-stories/IMG_5147.jpg">Mary’s wish was to receive her hospice care in the comfort of her own home; a wish that we are happy to accommodate. As our team made their visits over the first few days and weeks of her care, one things began to become very apparent. Mary wanted a makeover. She wanted to get dressed up again, she wanted get out the make-up, to feel pretty, and to live.<p>During our weekly interdisciplinary team meeting where our team gathers to discuss each patient individually and how we can best meet their care needs, the idea of organizing a makeover for Mary became a topic of discussion.<img class="inline-img-right" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbc2wlvk8/image/upload/f_auto,fl_any_format.lossy/v1500588509/agape/hospice-stories/IMG_5110.jpg" alt="curling hair hospice volunteer"><p>As a side note, each week when we sit in this team meeting for hours dialoguing about our patients and how we can meet their individual needs, it always strikes me how unique hospice is in the fact that once we conclude our clinical care coordination of our patients in that meeting, the conversation often continues into general dialogue about how we can best help enhance a particular aspect of a patient’s quality of life, even when those life enhancements are not clinical in nature. Our Volunteer Coordinator sits through these meetings, offering insights into the resources our volunteer program holds to help make people’s final wishes a reality. The social work team offers their insights. The nurses offer their thoughts and ideas. Even our Medical Director will pitch in thoughts that have nothing to do with being a doctor, but that have everything to do with helping a person whose health is failing regain some level of dignity and hope through something as simple as, for example, a makeover.<p>Back to Mary’s story – our Volunteer Coordinator, Sveno, got to work on planning this makeover event for Mary. Her family was involved and were very excited. A local makeup artist, Sarah, agreed to do the makeover for free. Everything was arranged for a Saturday morning.<p>Sveno arrived to document the event with professional photography in order to be able to provide Mary and her family great photos of her in her element. Sarah arrived with her make-up and got to work on getting Mary her favorite shades. They worked with her wardrobe to find the best fashion to dress her in.<p>Mary relished every moment of her makeover. No amount of medication, medical equipment, visits to the hospital, doctor office waiting rooms, or medical supplies could have accomplished what hospice was able to accomplish that morning. A team of medical professionals working together with the goal of meeting Mary’s truest human needs were able to bring her dignity in the simplest of ways. On that day, Mary was not dying on hospice; she was living.<p>I could not be happier for Mary and her family, and I could not be prouder of Team Agape and the work they do every day for patients just like Mary.',

				title: 'Study Shows Benefits of Hospice Care for People with Cancer Diagnosis',
				article: '<p>A <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.68.9257" target="_blank">recent study</a> published by the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) indicates that hospice care at the end-of-life for patients suffering from a terminal cancer diagnosis improves patient satisfaction and the fulfillment of end-of-life wishes, but the benefits appear to be dependent on how long the patient actually received hospice care.</p><p>In this particular study, the researchers interviewed 2,307 families of deceased patients that suffered from advanced lung or colorectal cancer, who were enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study, and who died in 2011.</p><p>They compared family-reported outcomes for the patients who received hospice care at EOL and those patients who did not receive any hospice care. The outcomes compared included the presence and relief of common symptoms (ie, pain, dyspnea [a.k.a. shortness of breath]), concordance with patients with wishes for EOL care and place of death, and quality of EOL care.</p><p><strong>The results on the various outcomes were as follows:</strong></p><ol type="1"><li>Pain Management: 80% of the families of those enrolled in hospice care reported that their loved ones received “just the right” amount of pain medicine. This compares to 73% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li><li>Help with Shortness of Breath: 78% of the of the families of those enrolled in hospice care reported that their loved one got help with shortness of breath at the end-of-life. This compares to just 70% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li><li>EOL Wishes Being Followed: 80% of those enrolled in hospice had their end-of-life wishes followed. This in comparison to just 74% for those not enrolled in hospice care.</li><li>Quality of EOL Care: The families of those who were enrolled in hospice reported that their loved one received “excellent” end-of-life care 15% more frequently than those who did not receive hospice care.</li</ol><p>While these results are exceptional, the one factor that improved the scores most dramatically in favor of hospice care utilization was the number of days a person received hospice care leading up to their death.</p><p>For those who received less than eight total days of hospice care, the difference on those quality care indicators was negligible, and in fact the most significant differences surfaced when people entered hospice care 30 days or more prior to their death.</p><p>At Agape Hospice, we see this in practice every day. In this particular study, the terminal illness happened to be cancer, however I would venture a guess that the same outcome would be true for people afflicted by just about all terminal disease processes.</p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is the world’s leading professional organization for physicians and oncology professionals caring for people with cancer. They set various outcome measures for determining the quality of oncology patient care. One of their quality measures is “administering hospice care\”, however they only focus on administering three to seven days of care.</p><p>According to the JCO study, “Encouraging earlier and increased hospice enrollment may improve EOL experiences for patients with cancer and their families.”</p><p>I believe the JCO study shows the importance of improving on that quality metric by putting an emphasis on even earlier enrollment in hospice care, and I am pleased that the researchers encouraged the same. </p><p>As the JCO study concluded, “Hospice care is associated with better symptom relief, patient-goal attainment, and quality of EOL care.” At a time when solutions in the American health care system seem to be coming at an increasing premium, we need more emphasis on programs such as hospice, that put the patient at the center of the equation.</p>',

				title: 'Date Night',
				article: '<p>One of the core functions of a hospice is to assess and support the emotional needs of our patients and their loved ones. This is exactly what our social worker, Samira, was doing when she identified the need to plan an unforgettable date night for one of our patients, and his wife. </p><p>Several years ago, suffering from the debilitating effects of a stroke, Bob (name has been changed for confidentiality) was living at home, and Patsy, his wife (her name is also changed), was his primary caregiver. As Bob continued to decline in his functional capacity, the amount of care Patsy needed to give him was becoming too much for her to handle on her own. This forced her to make a decision that no family caregiver takes lightly. She made the decision to move him to a nursing home where he would receive around the clock care, relieving her of that impossible responsibility. </p><p>As the years went by, Bob continued his slow physical decline. Patsy was faithful to visit him as often as she could. In September of 2015, with a prognosis of 6 months or less to live, Bob was referred to our hospice. Upon his admission to hospice, both he and Patsy immediately began receiving personalized care, assessing Bob’s physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, as well as Patsy’s supporting needs. </p><p>As Bob declined physically, so did his ability to communicate effectively. He struggled to convey his true feelings about his surroundings, and about the people who surrounded him, often coming across in his gesturing as frustrated, angry, and annoyed. </p><p>One day, Samira sat down with Patsy to talk about how she was handling all that was going on with Bob. Patsy shared with Samira that it had become increasingly difficult to visit Bob. Patsy was beginning to feel like Bob did not appreciate her like he used to. He always seemed agitated when she visited him, and she was concerned he did not love her anymore. Samira did her best to reassure Patsy, but realized she would have to get Bob’s side of the story, and see whether or not this was just a result of Bob’s declining ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>The next time Samira met with Bob, she asked him about his feelings regarding his wife. She asked him if he still loved her, and if he appreciated her visiting him. He lit up. In his own special communicative style, Bob affirmed that he did very much love his wife, and that her visits were extremely meaningful to him. Wanting to make sure Patsy was reassured of this, Samira began putting together a plan.</p><p>She asked Bob if he would like to partner with her in setting up a date night for him and his wife. Nothing over the top, but special enough to reassure Patsy that Bob’s love for her was still alive and full. With a squeeze of a hand, and nod of the head, he affirmed that he was in full support of this endeavor, and indicated that he felt it was a wonderful idea.</p><p>The original plan was for it to be a surprise, but during a phone call with Patsy, to feel out what the best evening would be for her to pay a visit to the nursing home, Samira found out that Patsy had suffered a fall that week, and had broken her wrist. Seeing that the date night might be postponed a little bit, Samira decided to bring Patsy in on the secret plans, so as to avoid any confusion over why she would need to visit Bob on a specific evening.</p><p>Patsy was ecstatic over the idea of having one more date night with her true love. She immediately began giving Samira some additional information to help Samira in her planning. She explained to Samira that back in the day, Bob used to take her to their favorite restaurant, Old Father Inn where they would always order ribs, and that the ribs always came with a nice salad and a baked potato.</p><p>For additional help with logistics and date night entertainment, Samira went to our volunteer coordinator, Rosy. Once she heard the outline and plan, Rosy was all over it. She immediately rallied two of our amazing volunteers to help out. One volunteer, a former nurse named Kathy, would help with decorating the private dining room at the nursing home. Another volunteer, Dani, one of our talented musicians, would be there on date night to entertain the two lovebirds with some accordion music. Rosy played an important role in coordinating the volunteers on date night.</p><p>Once Patsy had regained enough strength to get back to the nursing home for a visit and a dinner, Samira set the date and time. The date would take place at 5pm on a Thursday evening. That Wednesday, Samira paid Bob a visit to remind him of the date the following night. Bob expressed that he was very excited, and ready to go.</p><p>On Thursday, Samira arrived an hour early to start getting everything set up. When she arrived at the nursing home, she went straight to the private dining room where date night would be taking place. When she reached the room, Bob was already there. He had gotten himself from his room to the dining room an hour early in anticipation of the date. </p><p>The volunteers arrived, and together with the help of the wonderful nursing home staff, they put together a beautiful date setting. Samira had also picked up a love-note card for Bob to give to his wife. She helped him sign it.</p><p>Once decorating was underway, Samira left to pick up the dinner at Old Father Inn. She also grabbed them a dessert and some flowers. When she returned, Patsy had already arrived, and the two were sitting at their table, holding hands, and listening to accordion music together. Samira served them their meal and left the two to enjoy their date.</p><p>In the coming days, Patsy shared with Samira that she was incredibly appreciative of what Samira, and the volunteers had put together for her and Bob that night. She said that she had a wonderful time and that she “never would have expected a hospice to do something like that.”</p><p>The reality is that hospice does do stuff like this. In hospice, we are tasked with providing personalized physical, emotional, and spiritual care to our patients and their families. For this family, that meant planning a date night.</p>',

				thumbAlt: 'Survey week feature image',
				title: 'Survey Week',
				article: '<p>Once again, Monday arrived. It was a pleasant Spring morning in Tucson, and April, our Administrator and lead Compliance Officer, was checking in online to view our account home page in the Joint Commission’s website.  After months of waiting, she finally saw a notification in the events calendar. Our surveyor was set to arrive at the office at 8:30 AM that morning to begin a four day in depth accreditation survey of our hospice. April sent messages to key staff to notify the rest of the team that the survey was beginning. Thus began our triennial survey week with the Joint Commission.</p><p>Before getting too far into how the survey week actually went, let us first step back and address what accreditation is. To operate a hospice, there are certain minimum standards that an agency must achieve in order to legally get into, and maintain, a hospice operation. </p><p>In order to open their doors, a hospice must receive a license from the department of health services from the state within which it is operating. Once the agency obtains their state license, they can begin providing hospice services. Unfortunately for that hospice, outside of individuals who can afford to pay for services privately, the hospice will not have many people interested in their services, because they won’t have any contracts with any insurances, including Medicare.</p><p>According to the 2015 Hospice Facts and Figures Report published by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), 85.5% of patients that received hospice care in 2014 had their hospice care paid for entirely by Medicare. Only 0.8% of hospice patients paid for their care privately, out of their own pockets. For a new hospice to have a viable option for receiving funding for their hospice program, they will have to expand away from just providing care to individuals who can self-fund their care. They will have to get contracts with insurance companies, and may look into getting certified by Medicare.</p><p>Since 85.5% of patients that receive hospice care have Medicare benefits, most new hospice agencies go that direction. To achieve this, in addition to obtaining the state license, the hospice agency must also pursue a Medicare certification. Once a Medicare certification is obtained, the hospice can begin billing Medicare for hospice care that they deliver to Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>Obtaining this Medicare certification can be a long process. The agency must begin by providing hospice care to a limited number of patients, without receiving reimbursement. They must maintain for a period of time while they wait for Medicare surveyors to arrive and survey the hospice agency, making sure that the services being provided meet Medicare’s conditions of participation. If the surveyors deem that the hospice agency is meeting the conditions of participation, Medicare will issue the hospice agency a certificate, and the hospice agency will become a Medicare provider. Once this occurs, the hospice can begin billing Medicare.</p><p>There is an alternative way to receive a Medicare certification, and that is through accreditation. The process of a hospice agency becoming accredited is similar to the process of becoming certified by Medicare. The hospice agency begins providing hospice care to a limited number of patients, but instead of Medicare surveyors coming to assess the hospice’s operation, a member of an accrediting body comes to assess the hospice agency.</p><p>Organizations that provide accreditation services typically hold hospices to a higher standard than the base line Medicare standards. There are typically two levels of accreditation. There is a level of accreditation that indicates the hospice has met the standards of the accrediting organization. There is another level of accreditation that indicates that the hospice agency has not only fully met the accrediting organization’s standards of excellence, but that they have also met all of the Medicare and state specific conditions of participation. This second level of accreditation is called Deemed Status.</p><p>When an agency achieves Deemed Status with an accrediting organization, the accrediting organization writes a letter to the state, and to Medicare, indicating that this hospice is meeting all the necessary standards of care. Upon receipt of this letter, Medicare provides the hospice with a letter of certification, and that hospice becomes a Medicare hospice provider. In addition to being a Medicare provider, the hospice gets that accrediting organization’s seal of excellence. Depending on the quality and reputation of the accrediting organization, that seal is an indication that this hospice has made an effort to provide the highest level of quality care.</p><p>In 2013, Agape Hospice elected to have the Joint Commission be our accrediting body. On March 6th, 2013, we received the Joint Commission’s deemed status accreditation. Accreditation certifications require a re-accreditation survey once every three years.</p><p>We chose the Joint Commission as our accreditation organization because we admired their reputation in the health care community. They are known for having the highest standards of excellence. While we could have had it easier with other accrediting organizations, we chose the Joint Commission because we knew that in our efforts to adhere to their rigorous standards, we would be pushed to maintain the highest level of quality in our day to day operation. Ever since March 6th, 2013, we have proudly displayed their seal of approval on a prominent wall in our clinical headquarters. </p><p>It does not take hard math to calculate that in March of this year, 2016, we would be due for a new seal of approval. Standing between us and that re-accreditation was a four-day survey to be conducted, unannounced, at some point during our survey window. The survey window, we were told, was anytime between November of 2015 and March of 2016.</p><p>The only notice we would get about when the survey would actually take place was by an alert on our account home page in the Joint Commission website. That is why April was looking at that page, that pleasant Spring morning in March. </p><p>We had been preparing for the survey since the last survey ended, but as the due date of the pending survey approached, we worked very hard, dotting every i and crossing every t. We continuously reviewed the standards and assessed our systems, making sure that we were performing at a high level.<p>By the time the surveyor arrived at our office, our team was prepared to show her how we fulfill the mission of hospice. During her opening meeting with our leadership team, the surveyor told us that she was here to validate our work, to offer insights for improvement, and to inspire the team, and that is exactly what she did. </p><p>Soon after that opening meeting, the Surveyor made plans to shadow several members of our team in the field, with a goal of observing their clinical skills at work at the bedside. One of the people she shadowed was Dana, one of our amazing hospice nurses. The surveyor remarked to the leadership team that on her shadowing visit with Dana, Dana had to perform wound care on the patient she was seeing. The surveyor remarked in her recap of that visit that the wound care Dana performed was some of the best wound care she had seen in the field in quite some time.</p><p>In another update to the leadership team, the surveyor explained how she had observed another one of our hospice nurses, Sylvia, and one of hospice aides, Rosy, dialogue about the plan of care for a patient that they both had under their care. Rosy explained to Sylvia that the patient’s decline was inhibiting her ability to safely, and comfortably get out of bed. Sylvia agreed and updated the care plan to include bed baths, instead of full trips to the shower. </p><p>The surveyor also interviewed numerous members of our team about their roles in the organization. One of the groups she spent time talking to was our social services and grief support teams. She asked Belinda, a member of our bereavement team, about the support groups that we facilitate. As Belinda explained how our groups worked, the surveyor was reminded of a grief support group that she had attended as a part of her own, recent, grief journey. The surveyor explained that in one of the groups she attended, the facilitator had brought a bunch of rocks. The rocks were of all shapes and sizes. They had varying color and appearance. Some were nice and smooth, others rough and jagged. The people attending the group were asked to pick up a rock that best described their grief journey, and then explain why they had chosen that specific rock. </p><p>By the end of this discussion on how we support the bereaved, there were hugs and tears as the discussion around the importance of grief support was had. The surveyor was supported by our team, while at the same time inspiring our team to explore new modes of facilitating grief support for those we care for.</p><p>The surveyor met with leaders in our clinical department to assess our processes for managing medications. In her exit meeting, she remarked at how thorough and effective the process for medication management appeared to be. </p><p>She met with April to discuss our process for identifying areas in our organization that from time to time require performance improvements. April explained how we track key quality measure in our program, and how we meet on a quarterly basis to review that data, to discuss it, and to develop plans for improvement when necessary.</p><p>She had more great things to say about the various people and teams that she met with than we have space to outline here. From the volunteer team, to the spiritual care team, to our physicians; she consistently found positive things to give feedback on.</p><p>When Thursday, the final day of the survey, finally arrived, the surveyor noted to us that she was planning to have her final exit meeting with us at 3:30pm that afternoon. We sent out an email to our whole team, inviting them to attend that exit meeting, to hear her recap of how we are doing as an agency. Our hope was that whether the exit meeting went well, or went south, it would be a learning experience for our whole team.</p><p>As 3:30 approached, our large conference room began to fill up with team members. A few minutes after 3:30, the surveyor came out of the room in which she had been working on her final report, her final assessment on how we are doing as a hospice.</p><p>She entered the conference room and was somewhat surprised to see so many people there to hear her report. She started out by telling us that we had an amazing team. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. She went on to highlight several of the things that most impressed her throughout her week of observing our team. She outlined some areas that she believed we could improve on. </p><p>While there were several items that she highlighted as areas that we can improve on, she said that many of the common issues that she finds at most hospice agencies’ first triennial, re-accreditation survey were not areas of weakness for our team. She mentioned that she frequently cites hospices on infection control protocols and medication management deficiencies, but that neither one of those areas presented a cause for concern for her at Agape Hospice.</p><p>The exit meeting ended with her encouraging the team to give themselves a round of applause. She did exactly what she set out to do. She validated the great hospice care that our team provides. She highlighted some things that we could do better. She inspired the team to keep up the great work. </p><p>As a team, we look forward to continuing to deliver consistently excellent, high quality hospice care to people on their final journey, and to their loved ones who continue on with cherished memories. We are excited to have the Joint Commission seal of approval hanging on our wall for three more years, and we look forward to welcoming the next surveyor from the Joint Commission to validate our team in 2019.</p><p>You can learn more about <a href="www.jointcommission.org" target="_blank">Joint Commission accreditation here</a>.</p>',

				article: '<p>One of the fundamental characteristics of hospice care is openness. We believe strongly that in order to facilitate quality care and support at the end of a person\'s life, we must have openness. We must have openness within our team, with the one who is dying, and with their family and loved ones. Without openness, last wishes can be missed, final words can go unsaid, and final good-byes can be lost. It was openness that prompted Carol to come sooner, rather than later, to bid farewell to her sister Mary.</p><p>We got the call on a Tuesday in late February, that a patient at a local nursing home was in urgent need of hospice care. Our admission nurse, Noel, arrived on site and confirmed that Mary was not doing well. She was suffering from the end stages of terminal dementia.</p><p>Mary had a sister named Carol. Carol lived in New York. When Mary came on to hospice services, we informed Carol of this update, and shared with her that her sister was not doing well, and that we recommended she come to visit soon. Carol said that she had plans to come in April to spend some time with her sister. We openly explained to Carol that Mary was not doing well, and would most likely not make it until April. If she wanted to spend some time with her sister, she needed to move her travel plans to a closer date.</p><p>A few days later, on Thursday, Katherine, Mary’s hospice social worker, made a visit to the nursing home. She observed that Mary was no longer eating. Mary’s hospice nurse, Sylvia, coordinated with the hospice doctor, and the care team at the nursing home to make sure that Mary was comfortable. One of our volunteers, Rose, spent time with Mary, just being there with her, providing her with companionship.</p><p>Katherine called Carol to inform her that Mary was no longer eating or drinking, and that once that phase of the dying process began, Mary only had a couple of days left. Carol said she had moved her plans from April to the following Tuesday. Katherine told her that typically once someone was no longer eating or drinking, five days is usually the longest the body can continue functioning. Tuesday was six days away. Katherine openly recommended that Carol move her plans again to be there even sooner.</p><p>On Sunday, one of our on-call nurses, Linda, paid a visit to Mary. She assessed her, and spoke with the nursing home staff. Mary was not responding to any verbal or physical stimuli. She was still alive, and she was comfortable, but she did not have much time left. </p><p>Linda placed a call to Carol to inform her of her sister’s serious condition. Carol said that she had moved her plans again. She had just landed in Tucson and was getting off the plane. Linda openly discussed Mary’s condition, and recommended to Carol that she come straight to the nursing home. Carol affirmed that as soon as she picked up the rental car, she would head straight over.</p><p>Linda also spoke with Gary, our hospice chaplain. He made a phone call and spoke with Carol. She was thankful for his comforting call, but did not request a spiritual care visit.</p><p>As soon as she picked up her rental car, Carol went straight to the nursing home. She was able to be there with her sister. Mary passed away just a few hours later. In a phone call with Carol the day after Mary had passed, Belinda, our bereavement coordinator, spoke to her about the whole experience. Carol had this to say:</p><p>"I\'m tired but doing good. I\'m so glad I was able to get here to spend the last 3 hours with my sister before she died. I was so happy for her that her spirit was released. I\'m sitting back now and resting a bit. I can\'t say enough about everyone at hospice. I don\'t know where you find these kind, caring, and helpful people. It didn\'t matter who I spoke with. Everyone was wonderful. I could be churning with anxiety, but every time I would hang up the phone after talking to one of you I felt calm and realized everything was going to be okay. </p><p>The more I hear that my sister was waiting for me, the more I am starting to believe it. I kept telling her it was Carol. I\'d kiss her forehead and stroke her hair. I was holding her hand and talking to her. I gave her permission to go and within 10 second she stopped breathing. She did breathe again, but it was the beginning of the end. I truly believe now that she was waiting for me. </p><p>I am really sad and tears flow, but at the same time I am happy that she could let go and set her spirit free. So many of the staff popped in and told me stories before she died. It was like an Irish wake. It was a chapter I would otherwise not have known. I got great insight of who she was at the nursing home and I guess she was a pistol. I feel so amazed. People kept saying she was waiting for me. I\'m so thankful she did. </p><p>I met with the funeral home. Agape made this process easier too because of some form they provided the funeral home. I am grateful to you all from the bottom of my heart. You all made it so easy for me to be present with her yesterday. Please say thank you to everyone else that you work with. I may not have met them, but that is because they were helping other family members like myself.”</p><p>Mary and Carol’s story is one of openness. The hospice team was open with Carol about the realities of Mary\’s condition. Carol was open with Mary about her love for her. Without openness, it is very difficult to manage care, emotions, and relationships at the end of life. With openness, we can help bring comfort, peace, and resolution into every life that we are invited in to.</p>',

Late in the afternoon a call came in from a local skilled nursing facility saying that they had a patient who needed urgent care from our hospice team. Within a short amount of time, Fran, one of our admissions nurses, was on the scene evaluating Everett for hospice. She discussed Everett’s disease and symptoms with our on-call physician, Dr. Kelly, and decided to admit him to inpatient care for treatment of that terminal agitation previously mentioned.</p><p>When April arrived at Everett’s room two days later, he was not doing well. He was extremely agitated. Despite numerous visits the previous day from many members of our hospice team, Everett’s agitation and confusion was persisting. He had wound himself up in his sheets, appeared disheveled, and his breathing was fast paced. He appeared to be in physical and emotional turmoil.</p><p>April quickly started helping Everett up in his bed. As she started working to get Everett settled and laying peacefully in his bed, Heidi arrived and immediately started assisting April.</p><p>Heidi is a member of our social work team. The previous day, her and Katherine, the leader of our social work team, had stepped in and began working on a long-term residential care plan for Everett, should he need a place to live after his in-patient care. Seeing that Everett’s decline was happening fast, they looked to see what, if any, financial resources he had. It was limited.</p><p>They found out that Everett was a veteran of the Korean War. He had spent four years in the Air Force. Having served in active duty during wartime gave Everett potential access to long-term care benefits that could help him with paying for assisted living care. It also made services at the VA hospital a possible option. The team opened up communication with the VA and began coordinating a potential longer-term solution for Everett.</p><p>Everett’s time spent protecting our country also meant that our team would get to be a part of honoring him for his service, under our We Honor Veterans program. Our volunteer coordinator, Rosy, coordinates our veteran honoring ceremonies. She was alerted of Everett’s service in the Air Force. She was also told the time sensitive nature of Everett’s prognosis.</p><p>Rosy immediately got to work coordinating an effort to honor Everett. Derek, a member of our volunteer team, and also an active duty member of our military, agreed to conduct the ceremony the following morning. A note went out to our care team that the ceremony would be taking place on Saturday, and that anyone who could attend, was welcome.<p>Once April had helped Everett get resituated in his bed that Saturday, Derek and Gary arrived to help April and Heidi in honoring Everett for his military service. Everett’s health was beginning to really decline. His energy levels were waning.</p><p>Derek, who had arrived in his full military uniform, knelt next to Everett’s bed. He took Everett’s hand and quietly thanked him for his service. Derek said “I want to honor you for paving the path for me and other soldiers like me.” This resonated with Everett. For the first time that day, Everett opened his eyes in a brief moment of clarity, looked at Derek, and said “Thank you.”</p><p>Everett’s wife passed away several years ago. When Everett was initially evaluated by our hospice, the only close friend or relative that he had to speak for him was a former sister-in-law. She lived out of state, but was very willing to work with us to develop a plan of care that best aligned with Everett’s best interests and wishes. Everett’s sister-in-law was a good friend to Everett. She called him on a weekly basis. She had indicated to Gary, our chaplain, that Everett was a Christian, and that praying with him would be a great comfort.</p><p>The previous day, Everett’s sister-in-law had called April while she had been doing a nursing visit with Everett. She wanted to speak with Everett. April explained that he was not able to carry a conversation, but agreed that hearing her voice could be a comfort to him. April was able to put her phone on speakerphone and set it close to Everett’s ear. Through audible tears, his sister-in-law was able to assure Everett of her family’s love for him, and that he wasn’t alone.</p><p>April indicated that hearing her voice seemed to give Everett a real peace. April was then able to have a longer conversation with Everett’s sister-in-law, speaking at length about Everett’s condition, and giving her up to date information on how he was doing. His sister-in-law said that she was grateful for the opportunity to speak to him, and wanted to make sure the hospice team knew to reinforce with him that his family loved him and cared for him, even though they could not be there in person.</p><p>That Saturday, after Everett had been honored for his military service, April was cleaning up his room. Gary was by Everett’s side. He prayed with him. April said that she noticed that as Gary prayed, Everett’s respirations slowed. He seemed more at peace than he had through the first 2 days of his care.</p><p>When they had made sure Everett was comfortable and at peace, April conferred with the skilled nursing home nurse who would continue to monitor Everett. They discussed his medications and his condition. April, Derek, and Heidi said good-bye to him and left. Gary stayed behind a little longer.</p><p>Before leaving Gary played Amazing Grace on his phone. He had played it the day before while he was visiting Everett, and he said that the song seemed to bring Everett a deeper sense of peace. Gary prayed once more with Everett, who by now was in a much more peaceful state than they had encountered him in that morning. He was comfortable and resting.</p><p>Seeing that he was at peace, Gary eventually left Everett’s room.  Two hours later our on-call team received a call from the nursing home. Everett had passed away peacefully in his bed. Samira, our social worker who was working on-call that day, coordinated his funeral plans.</p><p>According to the 2015 facts and figures report published by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association, the average number of days that a patient is on hospice services is 72 days. While Everett’s length of stay was shorter than average, our approach to his care was the same. He received holistic, individualized care from a hospice team that was committed to his peace and comfort.</p>',
