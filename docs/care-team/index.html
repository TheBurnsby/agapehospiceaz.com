       					<p>As Director of Social Services, Katherine Perkins is our number one problem solver. She works one on one with many of our patients making sure they get all the financial benefits they are entitled to, setting up advanced directives, and coordinating care plans with other care providers our patients interface with. For those patients she does not directly work with, she oversees our team of social workers, making sure every patient’s social service needs are met. With over 8 years of experience in social work, Katherine is a great community resource for us, and our patients.</p>
       					<p>Katherine loves working with the senior population. She had a very close relationship with her grand-parents and step-grandparents, and watched them battle terminal illness. It was during this time that she made her decision to become a social worker. Working in hospice has provided her the opportunity to work with the community she loves during their end of life process. She enjoys learning so much from the people and family’s we serve everyday. In her spare time she enjoys experimental cooking. While she admits cooking is not her strong point, she loves doing it none-the-less.</p>

Jordana co-facilitates our Agape Adult Grief Support Groups and also provides individual grief support to members of the community. Ensuring families recognize and understand that hospice is available as a support not only to an individual at end-of-life, but also to their family both during this journey and after death occurs, is of the utmost importance to Jordana.</p>
						<p>Jordana recently moved back to Arizona, where she was raised. She is elated to be home after spending several years in Boston, where she became acquainted with using phrases like “wicked smart,” and learned how to drive in snow storms to visit her hospice patients.</p>

						<p>Jordana has a passion for working with individuals and families during their end-of-life experiences, and feels incredibly honored to be welcomed into their lives at such an emotionally-laden time. She began volunteering as a hospice volunteer in Phoenix as a teenager, and knew from a young age that being a hospice social worker was her calling. Jordana is enjoying being back on the West Coast, nearer to her family. When Jordana’s not enjoying the warmer weather and friendlier traffic, she loves watching movies, reading, and cooking.</p>

Gary doesn't see his role as a job as much as he sees it as a true ministry. While Gary comes from the Christian faith, he coordinates with ministers from all faiths, ensuring that each patient’s spiritual needs are met, regardless of their spiritual background.</p>

						<p>The hospice chaplain provides spiritual counseling and support during a time when that counseling and support is most important. Gary Henry is just the person to provide that important service to our patients, their loved ones, and those involved in the care process. Gary meets individually with patients and their loved ones, when requested, to discuss spirituality, it’s role in the dying process, and what it means for both the patient, and their family.</p>

						<p>Gary’s interests include spending time with his wife Kim Henry, and 3 kids. He loves participating in his kids activities, which include attending wallyball tournaments, sporting events and other things important to them.</p>

       					<p>Catherine is originally from New Orleans and hold a degree in communication from Louisiana State University. Her 30-year career as a hospitality professional has given her the opportunity of living and travelling in many regions of the United States and around the world. This has afforded her the valuable experience to work with many diverse & cultural backgrounds which has developed her communication skills, adaptability and a genuine & sincere spirit of service and a passion for working with everyone she encounters.</p>

						<p>As a Community Liaison for Agape Hospice, Catherine introduces the benefits of hospice care by educating the public, families, care providers and health professionals on the benefits of receiving hospice care. “Collaborations, partnerships, relationships and above all, effective communication is what drives patient centered care.”</p>

						<p>“Losing my husband at an early age to cancer, gave me the gift of understanding the valuable benefits of hospice not only for my late husband but for me and my entire family.  And, still.  It is an absolute privilege and an honor to work along side our team of professionals as well all of our healthcare partners toward providing utmost comfort care for our patients achieving the highest quality of life possible during their final chapter of their journey.”</p>

					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Hospice is not about dying, rather it is about living and maximizing the quality of life that a person has remaining. It recognizes death as a normal part of life and engages not only the patient but also loved ones as it provides a team of specialists to care for people as they write that final chapter of life’s journey.</p>
